    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>Previously working in a private art gallery in Prague, Mono (David Kejr) moved on to focus on his art-making and managing/touring with music bands for four years where he traveled and opened his horizons about life.</p>
    <p>His real start in tattooing only happened in 2013, when he inked his friends (i.e. exploring styles and techniques) and simply enjoying tattooing like any other creative outlet. With time his passion for this medium grew and that led him to serious, elaborate projects. His current technique is marked by dots or lines, highly abstract and minimalist concepts that depict his artistic expression, life philosophy and the city where he chooses to live in: Berlin.</p>
